    <h1>Extras</h1>

    <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or <a href="../images.html">images</a>. </p>

<h2>Character Sets</h2>
<p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
<ol>
    <li>bir</li>
    <li>iki</li>
    <li>üç</li>
    <li>dört</li>
    <li>beş</li>
</ol>

<h2>HTML Entities</h2>

<p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
<p>Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). In between you put in the special code that your browser will interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets <em>lt, gt,</em>and <em>amp</em> as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols.</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<p>Curly quotes aren't really necessary, but there are four different kinds that we can use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&ldquo;</li>
    <li>&rdquo;</li>
    <li>&lsquo;</li>
    <li>&rsquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use them in place of ' and " straight quotes, like so:</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find   yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
